# swagger_gen
Swagger Gen is a tool that generates Open API compliant yaml files for API Gateway. It provides a convention over configuration approach to generating open api files. This recudes the amount of code you need to write, provides early validation, and helps avoid common pitfalls.

# Usage
The open_api.json file provides a good template to get started. I'm working on actually documentation.
